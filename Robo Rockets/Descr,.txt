Have you ever wanted to [b]truly[/b] automate rockets, just to have been hit with the tetris of cramming a livable space and life support into the rocket to keep the mandatory pilot alive?

[b]Then this mod is for you![/b]

[h1]Current latest Version: 1.2.3[/h1]

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Features[/h1]
This mod adds a new command module to your rocket arsenal, the [b]AI Control Module[/b].
This module wont allow any duplicants to enter since it's a closed environment for an artifical brain.
Instead, this small brain is hooked into the rocket and will fly everywhere a normal piloted rocked could.
The module is mutually exclusive with other command modules.
With this module, Rockets can fly truly automated now!

[h1]Requirements[/h1]
[list]
    [*]locked behind the research "High Velocity Destruction" (Automated Rockets are pretty high tech)
    [*]Requires 300 refined metal [b]and[/b] a neural vaccilator recharge (to "grow" the brain, the charge gets recovered on deconstruction).
[/list] 

[h1]Configuration[/h1]
Mod Option: "Advanced Recipe" - Disable this to to remove the neural vaccilator recharge from the build cost.

[h1]Remarks[/h1]
This mod is my first mod ever created.
Additionally, the framework of the rockets in the DLC is a duct taped mess.
Therefore, some parts from the normal rockets are still there, but won't have any function, for example; access control.

before uninstalling, remove all existing AI control modules in the save game, otherwise that save will crash on load.
