[h1]Current latest Version: 1.0.0[/h1]

[hr][/hr]
[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] When groomed, fluffy critters will shed some of their fluffy fur, resulting in a small amount of reed fiber being dropped. The amount is dependant on the critter type and the grooming skill of the rancher
[*] Fluffy critters are: Cuddle Pip, Longhair Slickster, Sage Hatch and normal Drecko. If one of these doesn't seem fluffy to you, you can disable it in the mod options.
[*] Dropped fur comes with its own texture, the mod can however be safely disabled, these fur balls will revert back to the normal reed fiber texture.
