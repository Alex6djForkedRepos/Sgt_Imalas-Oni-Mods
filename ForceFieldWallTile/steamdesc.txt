[h1]Features[/h1]
[list][*] New Building: Forcefield Projector
[*] Requires 100kg of refined metals.
[*] Unlocked with the research "Projectiles".
[*] Consumes 50W while charging its barrier, 10W while at maximum charge (values configurable)
[*] Barrier takes 10 seconds to fully charge up to maximum strength
[*] Barrier blocks liquids, gases and meteors.
[*] Items, Duplicants and Critters can pass through the barrier (duplicants get slowed while doing so).
[*] Duplicants passing through a barrier will drain some of its strength.
[*] Meteors hitting a forcefield will drain some of its strength
[*] Large adjacent liquid masses will excert a constant drain on the barrier strength
[*] Barrier damage is shared with adjacent forcefield projectors; building multiple rows of projectors increases the effective strength of each individual segment.
[*] If a barrier collapses, it will take a few seconds to 'cool down' before it starts regenerating
[*] if the projector loses power, its barrier will collapse instantly, so make sure you have energy buffers
