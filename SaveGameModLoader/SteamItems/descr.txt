[h1]Introduction[/h1]

This mod stores the individual mod configs of your savegames and allows you to switch between different savegames with deviating mod lists with one click.
To generate a mod list, just load the corresponding save or save your game with the mod enabled.

[h2]This is a beta release, there may be bugs. If you find one, please report it to me.[/h2]

[h1]Current latest Version: 1.0.0[/h1]

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] Loading a Savegame will copy the mod-config stored in that savegame and will enable syncing to that.
[*] Saving the game stores the List of currently enabled mods as the mod config of that save.
[*] Load Menu has a new "Sync"-Button, it becomes enabled if there is a stored mod config. Clicking that sync-button opens the MOD SYNC MENU:[list]
    [*] Will list all mods that are not in sync:[list]
        [*] enabled mods that are disabled in the stored mod config
        [*] disabled mods that are enabled in the stored mod config
    [/list] 
    [*] Clicking "Sync All and Load" will synchronize all mods to the stored config, afterwards it will restart the game and automatically load the save
    [*] Clicking "Sync Current Config and Load" will load the state the modlist is on click, allowing you to manually select the mods you want to have enabled/disabled
    [*] If all mods are in sync, the menu will be empty and will have an extra green button telling that.
    [*] If there are mods in the mod config that are not installed, the menu will get a red button that will display them in a popup (and log them to the player.log)
    [/list] 
[*] See the steam images for visual explanation.

[h1]Disclaimer[/h1]
[list]
[*]Do not close the Sync Menu with a right click next to it, it will prevent the mod menu from refreshing until you hit one of the close buttons in either of the menus.
[*]Mod Syncing is only supported in the main menu. I disabled it in the ingame load menu, since using that causes a base game bug which reinstalls and shuffles the entire modlist.
[*]Crashes that happen while loading WILL wrongfully blame this mod for the crash. This happens due to the fact that modlists get created during loading. It is save to keep the mod enabled after such a crash, since these crashes often occur due to missing/not enabled mods.
