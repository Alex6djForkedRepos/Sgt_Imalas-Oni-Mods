[h1]Features[/h1]
[list][*] Items can no longer get stuck in Neutronium tiles
[*] Check runs once at loading the save and per individual item when its buried state update - no performance impact during the game
[*] If an item is stuck in Neutronium, it will check its adjacent cells, favouring those above it. It will then teleport to the first cell thats not neutronium or a constructed tile (regardless of the tile element state). Potential target cells for this are up to 4 tiles away.
