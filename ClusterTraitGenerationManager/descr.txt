[h1]Cluster Generation Manager [DLC][/h1]

Gain nearly full control over each tiny detail of your cluster generation - manipulate each item on the star map individually!

[h1]Current latest Version: 1.3.2[/h1]

[hr][/hr]

[h1]How to start[/h1]
When loading into the cluster selection, you will find a new "Gear"-Button next to the seed.
Preselect the cluster you want to have as base preset for your custom cluster, then click that button.
Now the configuration window will appear, allowing you to fully manipulate each starmap item individually.
You can Activate/Deactivate a planet by double clicking or setting the checkmark on the right panel.
Once everything is configured, hit the "Start Game" button to generate the cluster.
If you forgot some settings (stuff like difficulty, story traits) on the normal screen, you can safely back out from the custom cluster screen, change those settings and go back in. The customized settings only reset if you select a different cluster (since it then loads that as new preset). 

[h3]Use the "Start modified Game"-button in the CGM menu to trigger custom generation, using the regular button does not apply your custom settings![/h3]

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] Preset Generation from ALL clusters
[*] Support for all modded planets (e.g. Baator, Roller Snakes, Other Cluster,...)
[*] Configurable star map radius
[*] Randomly selected planets pois in each category
[*] Set spawning parameters for each planet and poi individually, these include:[list]
    [*] should the planet/poi appear at all
    [*] spawn distance to star map center (min & max distance)
    [*] minimum distance to other planetoids
    [*] Asteroid Traits (support for modded traits like f.e. "Holes" from Empty Worlds, "Iron Core" from Solar System Worlds)
    [*] "Random Traits"-Trait
    [*] Asteroid Size (currently only allows to create larger asteroids as trying to make them smaller ones breaks world generation)
    [*] (only random planets & pois): Number of instances that should be spawned
    [/list]
[/list]
Planned/Work in Progress:[list]
[*] Planet Meteor Shower types
[/list]


[h2]Some notes on customized Generation[/h2]
Extreme configurations can let the worldgen fail more easily (e.g. selecting a large amount of asteroids, but don't adjust their position rules and/or the map size).
When a seed fails however, the config is kept, so you can retry with a different seed.
[list]
[*]when using large amount of planets, don't forget to increase their allowed spawn area and the starmap size
[*]when choosing to play with a small amounts of small planets, story traits have a higher chance to let the worldgen fail, consider disabling those in such cases. 
[*]Do not set multiple planets to (min. 0, max 0), this guarantees a failure since multiple planets cannot exist on the same tile (the center in this case).
[*]when choosing to play with a single planet, deselect the teleporters in the normal cluster settings before going into the cluster configuration. (otherwise the teleporter buildings still spawn, but cannot connect, leading to a crash when you click them)
[*]When custom planets are installed it can lead to there existing copies of planets if that mod implements their own variant of that planet, these can generate safely together
