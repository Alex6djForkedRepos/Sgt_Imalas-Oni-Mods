[h1]Cluster Generation Manager [DLC][/h1]

Gain nearly full control over each tiny detail of your cluster generation - manipulate each item on the star map individually!

[h1]Current latest Version: 1.0.0[/h1]

[hr][/hr]

[h1]How to start[/h1]
When loading into the cluster selection, you will find a new "Gear"-Button next to the seed.
Preselect the cluster you want to have as base preset for your custom cluster, then click that button.
Now the configuration window will appear, allowing you to fully manipulate each starmap item individually.
You can Activate/Deactivate a planet by double clicking or setting the checkmark on the right panel.
Once everything is configured, hit the "Start Game" button to generate the cluster.

[h1]Features[/h1]

[*] Preset Generation from ALL clusters
[*] Support for all modded planets (e.g. Baator, Roller Snakes, Other Cluster,...)

[h2]Some notes on customized Generation[/h2]
Extreme configurations can let the worldgen fail more easily (e.g. selecting a large amount of asteroids, but don't adjust their position rules and/or the map size).
When a seed fails however, the config is kept, so you can retry with a different seed.
[list]
[*]when using large amount of planets, don't forget to increase their allowed spawn area and the starmap size
[*]when choosing to play with a small amounts of small planets, story traits have a higher chance to let the worldgen fail, consider disabling those in such cases. 
[*]Do not set multiple planets to (min. 0, max 0), this guarantees a failure since multiple planets cannot exist on the same tile (the center in this case).
[*]when choosing to play with a single planet, deselect the teleporters in the normal cluster settings before going into the cluster configuration. (otherwise the teleporter buildings still spawn, but cannot connect, leading to a crash when you click them)
[*]When custom planets are installed it can lead to there existing copies of planets if that mod implements their own variant of that planet, these can generate safely together
