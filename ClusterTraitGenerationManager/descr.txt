[h1]Cluster Generation Manager [DLC][/h1]

Gain nearly full control over each tiny detail of your cluster generation - manipulate each item on the star map individually!

[h1]Current latest Version: 1.0.0[/h1]

[hr][/hr]

[h1]How to start[/h1]
When loading into the cluster selection, you will find a new "Gear"-Button next to the seed.
Preselect the cluster you want to have as base preset for your custom cluster, then click that button.
Now the configuration window will appear, allowing you to fully manipulate each starmap item individually.
You can Activate/Deactivate a planet by double clicking or setting the checkmark on the right panel.
Once everything is configured, hit the "Start Game" button to generate the cluster.

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] Preset Generation from ALL clusters
[*] Support for modded planets (e.g. Baator, Roller Snakes, Other Cluster,...)
[*] Configurable star map radius
[*] Random planets and pois for each category
[*] Random teleporter planet
[*] Set spawning sarameters for each planet and poi individually, these include:[list]
    [*] should the planet/poi appear at all

    [*] minimum distance to other planetoids
    [*] (only random planets & pois): Number of instances that should be spawned
    [/list]
[/list]


[h2]Warnings[/h2]
[list]
[*]Extreme configurations can let the worldgen fail more easily. 
[*]When a seed fails however, the config is kept, so you can retry with a different seed.
[*]Do not set multiple planets to (min. 0, max 0), this guarantees a failure since multiple planets cannot exist on the same tile (the center in this case).
