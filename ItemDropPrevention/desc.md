[h1]Grip Now Included[/h1]

Dupes and Rovers tend to drop items when loading into a game, as well as when they get interrupted by something.
If this happens while on a ladder, fire pole or in a transit tube, the item tends to fall a long way
With this mod, they will now hold onto that item until they are above solid ground again, preventing these long falls.

An improved and open source alternative to "NoDrop //by Ony", created at the request of several people on the Oni Discord.

[h3]Mod is marked as "incompatible" / the game is stuck in an "update loop"?[/h3]
This means that the game failed to install the mod. This is usually caused by Ony Mod Manager breaking the download or OneDrive breaking the games' ability to install mods.
Follow [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3522703974]this guide[/url] to fix the OneDrive issue and replace Ony Mod Manager with Mod Updater if not done already.
