[h1]Features[/h1]
[list][*] [b]All[/b] POI buildings and props of all dlcs become available as constructable buildings.
[*] All poi buildings are in their own build menu category, not cluttering the existing ones
[*] POI lamps are additionally added as functional lamps.
[*] Story Trait buildings become available for construction (Note: try not to mass construct them, the underlying story systems are not made to handle that. For the Hermit, construct the mailbox first, then the container, otherwise you will have to save-load to start the quest)
[*] Dlc Content thats not available will be automatically excluded
[*] Some POIs will allow different animations, these are selectable when clicking on them (note that anim names are not translatable)
[*] All building names are taken from the game internals and will be automatically translated
