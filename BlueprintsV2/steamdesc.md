[h1]Current latest Version: 1.0.0[/h1]

[hr][/hr]
[h1]Features[/h1]
[list][*] Storing and placing of blueprints - copy large structures in an instant
[*] Snapshot tool - quick copying without blueprint creation
[*] Blueprint Selection UI - select from all your blueprints, neatly arranged as a list
[*] Compatible with existing blueprints - blueprints created from the original blueprint mod (and its fixed version) are imported
[*] Settings Transfer - blueprints now store building settings on creation and apply them when placed (if you find this not working for a setting, please notify me; does not apply to blueprints of the old mod)
[*] Material Swapping - when placing a blueprint, you now get a preview of the material list with the option to swap out missing materials for available ones.

[h3]Mod is marked as "incompatible"?[/h3]
(remove ony mod manager and) install [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2018291283]Mod Updater[/url]!
This problem is caused by a rare mod extraction bug that gets massively amplified by ony mod manager.

you can also grab a direct download on [url=https://github.com/Sgt-Imalas/Sgt_Imalas-Oni-Mods/releases]GitHub[/url] to get the latest version
