Ronivan's Legacy 1.9

New:

- new alloy: Permendur, made from cobalt and iron, intended for swampy asteroid starts, made at the selective arc furnace
- added nitrate nodules recipe to mixing unit
- added expeller press recipes for viable dupes cuisine plants
- added dedicated texture for zinc ore, it no longer looks like tinted lead
- added refined carbon as an alternative input for burnable solids in various locations and recipes

Changes & Tweaks:

- fixed boilers having way higher efficiency increase than intended (91% instead of 50%)
- liquid and gas boiler now produce the same amount of water the respective vanilla generators produce by reducing their water input requirement
- increased wooden boiler efficiency to be more competative with wood->syngas conversion as a power source
- increased natural gas yield of biomass and algae digestion recipes to be in line with balance calculations
- moved mosaic tile to same tech as marble tile, since it offers the same stats and its old tech was cluttered
- increased font size of port tooltips slightly, decreased text width, centered text vertically relative to icon
- decreased efficiency of hatch borax refinement to 25%
- increased efficiency of crusher borax refinement to 10%
- increased building mass of selective arc furnace to match metal refinery
- removed solid visco gel as viable material for modded plastic recipes
- salt is now a guaranteed product of shale and sedimentary rock crushing in the ball crusher mill, increased its yield; addressing salt scarcity on swampy and relica starts

Fixes:
- fixed plasma furnace not emitting magma
- fixed plasma furnace and glass foundry creating duplicate materials in bottles
- fixed plasma furnace and glass foundry not clearing the "melting warning" tooltip properly when replacing pipes
- fixed pipe connection tooltips of a port no longer displaying the correct text when moving a modded building plan port over it
- fixed some log spam in the building tool
