[h1] Ronivan's Legacy - Industrial Revolution[/h1]
[h2]Whats this project?[/h2]
As you might have heard, Ronivan has passed away.
For many years, Ronivan was one of the premiere modders in the ONI community.
His mods offer a massive expansion to regular progression, and some mods alone could even be considered a DLC in scope.
With detailed handcrafted graphics, to carefully considered balance, to entirely new systems, Ronivan attracted many admirers in the ONI community for his incomparable work.
It is for these reasons, I believe the content he made should not be lost to an update breaking them in the future (which is something that would happen eventually).

[h2]Project Goals[/h2]
The target of this project is the creation of one, huge mod that incorporates and remasters all of Ronivan's industrial mods into one, configurable "modpack".
Individual sub-mods can be toggled off by the player if they do not want them in their game.
You will also be able to not only turn off submods, but individual buildings as well.

[h2]Why one mod?[/h2]
Several mods have overlaps in content.
For example; Mineral Processing - Metallurgy shares nearly all its buildings with Chemical Processing - Industrial Overhaul, leaving the two mods incompatible.
Additionally, having these amounts of "duplication" over several mods massively increases the maintainance effort, as a bugfix has to be transferred over to each of these versions.
These overlaps have now been adressed by consolidating these duplicate buildings into a singular building each.

[h2]What Content is in this mod?[/h2]
This mod contains the content of the following mods:[list]

[b]This mod covers all the content of those, so you should not try to have them enabled alongside with this mod.[/b]

[h3]Wiki[/h3]
As a mod description does not offer enough space to properly describe everything, I have created a dedicated wiki to cover all the content, adjustments and tweaks of this mod.

You can find it here: https://sgt-imalas.github.io/Wiki/Ronivans%20Legacy/

[h2]Only want some of that content?[/h2]
If you only want some of the content, you can configure the mod that way!

You can both turn off entire sub-mods and individual buildings.

[h2]What does "Remaster" mean[/h2]
For the most part, this refers to quality of life additions, UI improvements and small bug fixes.
Some functions have been rewritten under the hood to be more maintainable, but for the most part, the mods should play like their original version.

I also made a few balance adjustments, but these can be changed or reverted in the mod config.

The largest deviation from the originals is the addition of heavy duty rails to High Pressure Applications, these serve as a rail version of high pressure pipes, and some early game balance adjustments to Logistic Rails.

For the full list of changes, please refer to the wiki.

[h2]Credits and Thanks[/h2]
This mod would not have been made without the original work of Ronivan, who created all the original mods,
thank you for everything you created my friend.

I would also like to thank the following people for helping me during development with testing, feedback and bug reports:[list]
[*] MilesObrienWasAUnionMan
[*] 梦乃(AiAe)
[*] Tesgri
[*] Gem
[*] Sonia_k 
[*] Kierbo05
[/list]

Also thanks to the following people providing mod translations:[list]
[*] 梦乃(AiAe) - Chinese
[/list]
(If you want to add a translation to the mod, the translation template can be found in the mod folder.)

Thank you Aki for making the Heavy-Duty Sweeper and Heavy-Duty Loader animations.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
All existing buildings of Ronivan's original mods should seemlessly transfer over to the same buildings in this mod within existing saves.

Existing fabricator buildings being transferred over from Ronivan's standalone mods migh lose their queued recipes due to internal changes to the fabricator system.

Generally, this mod should be compatible with other mods (we tested over 480 of the more common ones).

The Nuclear Processing content will only show up in Spaced Out, everything else is compatible with all game versions.

[h2]Issue handling, Bug Reports and Local Download[/h2]
Do [b]not[/b] attempt to use Ony Mod Manager to update this mod, it breaks the updating system, injecting an arbitrary timeout that WILL always fail at these filesizes, leaving the mod in a broken state.
Also due to that file size, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2018291283]Mod Updater[/url] is pretty much required to properly keep it up to date.


If you run into what looks like a "restart loop", or the mod is suddenly marked as incompatible, you most likely will have OneDrive interfering. 

Turn off OneDrive for your documents folder and follow the [url=https://support.klei.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029880551-Oxygen-Not-Included-Troubleshooting-Guide]Klei Troubleshooter[/url] to restore proper file permissions.

Also make sure to follow all steps described in my own [url=https://github.com/Sgt-Imalas/Sgt_Imalas-Oni-Mods/wiki/Troubleshooter-Guide]Troubleshooting Guide[/url] before commenting.



Should all attempts on automatic updating fail (or you are on a different platform than Steam), you can download the mod manually from my [url=https://github.com/Sgt-Imalas/Sgt_Imalas-Oni-Mods/releases/tag/AllMods_Automated_Build_FullRelease] GitHub release[/url].


If you find any bugs or crashes, please report these on [url=https://github.com/Sgt-Imalas/Sgt_Imalas-Oni-Mods/issues]GitHub[/url] or on my [url=https://discord.gg/5n7peBCnWZ]Discord Server[/url].

[b]Always include the full player.log in a report: [/b] https://github.com/Sgt-Imalas/Sgt_Imalas-Oni-Mods/wiki/Troubleshooter-Guide#sending-a-log

[b]Make sure you do NOT have the mod "Debug Console // by @Ony 👾" enabled as it breaks the game internally and makes the log useless for debugging![/b]
