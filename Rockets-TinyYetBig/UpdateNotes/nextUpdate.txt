New Features:
- Drillcone Mining now recieves a boost from the pilots Flying and Digging Skills. AI rockets get a reduced bonus (can be toggled in config, enabled by default)
- Added "Drop All" to Fuel Loaders, Cargo Loaders and liquid fuel tanks
- liquid Rocket Fuel Tanks will no longer fill with liquids that arent rocket fuel (combustible liquids and hydrogen)

New Modules:
- Docking module: add it to an AI rocket to allow it to dock. Dupes can not use this to go to the other rocket. constructing multiple modules of this type allows multiple rockets to link together in space.
(Note: Docking can be used to tow a stranded rocket or to increase the speed of slow rockets, boosting it by docking to a fast rocket. More functions to come...)
- Liquid Chlorine Oxidizer Tank: a stepping stone towards liquid oxygen, liquid chlorine has a oxidizer efficiency of 3 (oxylite has 2, liquid oxygen has 4)

Fixes:
- fixed vanilla bug of oxidizer tanks losing their contents on loading the game when "copy settings" from a different oxidizer tank was used to set their settings
