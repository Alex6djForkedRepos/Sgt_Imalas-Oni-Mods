Update 3.0:

New Modules:
- NatGas Engine: new engine that burns natural gas & oxidizer
- Solar Nosecone: Nosecone + Solar panels
- Carbon Dioxide Fuel Tank: Stores additional CO2 to increase the range of a CO2 Engine.

New Buildings:
- Insulated Loader Adapter
- Fuel Loader

- Docking Bridge

Art for the new modules is made by the wonderful |ScientisT|UA|

Features:
- Docking: Dock rockets together while in space to transfer ressources and dupes.
//- Space Stations: Large Space bases that offer new livable areas but require orbital upkeep
- Fuel Loaders: These buildings allow automatic refueling of rockets (either docked to a space station or when landed)
- Generators: added a status item to the rocket that displays the fuel state of all generators
- Rocket gas/liquid input/output wall tiles now allow constructing Fittings connected to it
- Rocket Batteries now add a status item that displays total charge
- Added Tooltips to rocket modules, similar to how the normal build menu functions

Fixes & Adjustments:
- the Fortified Rocket Platform now works correctly with loaders / unloaders
- the "switch module" button is now disabled on habitats to prevent a vanilla crash that happens when you try that
- hopefully fixed a crash that would happen after deconstructing a module
- Reworked Critter Containment Module ---> Critter Stasis Module to fix the fact critters would sometimes just die
