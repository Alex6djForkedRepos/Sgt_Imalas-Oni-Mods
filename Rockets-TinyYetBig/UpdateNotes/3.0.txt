Update 3.0:

New Modules:
- NatGas Engine: new engine that burns natural gas & oxidizer
- Solar Nosecone: Nosecone + Solar panels

New Buildings:
- Insulated Loader Adapter

Art for the new modules is made by the wonderful |ScientisT|UA|
Features:
- Docking: Dock rockets together while in space to transfer ressources and dupes.
- Space Stations: Large Space bases that offer new livable areas but require orbital upkeep

Fixes & Adjustments:
- the Fortified Rocket Platform now works correctly with loaders / unloaders
- the "switch module" button is now disabled on habitats to prevent a vanilla crash that happens when you try that
- mod options wont reset their configuration in upcoming updates now
