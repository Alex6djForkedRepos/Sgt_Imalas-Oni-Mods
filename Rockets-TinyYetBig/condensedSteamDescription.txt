[h1]Introduction[/h1]
[h2]More Rockets - more fun![/h2]

This mod aims to increase rocket versatility by adding new rocket modules, rocket mechanics and in general adding to the experience of rocketry in Spaced Out.

[h1]Current latest Version: 2.3.5[/h1]

[hr][/hr]
[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] Interior Shrinking: Rockets no longer take up 32x32 Tiles, instead the interior size gets set dependant on the actual interior space used (disableable, a change only applies to newly constructed modules).
[*] Removal of Rocket cap of 16 (This is possible due to the space saving from the interior shrinking).
[*] Module Building Categories - no longer an endless scrolling fest (disableable) 
[*] Generator Modules (produce power while not landed without the need to move the rocket)
[*]Habitat Power Plug: Connect the internal electric grid to the outside without the need for a battery module
[*] Tweaks to Vanilla Modules: [list]
	[*]Cartographic Module Buff: The Cartographic Module will now instantly reveal all Space Hexes in a radius of 1 ( adjustable in mod settings).
	[*]Petroleum Engines: Can now also be fueled with Ethanol
	[*]Large Solid Oxidizer Tank Buff: Capacity 900 -> 1350, this gives it 3x the capacity of one small tank while taking 2.5x height and weight of one (and gives a reason to use this module)
	[*]more wip.
	[/list]
[*] each new module and most features can be individually toggled on&off / tweaked in the mod config.

[h1]New Rocket Modules[/h1][list]
	[*][h2]Habitat Modules[/h2][list]
		[*][h3]Extended Solo Spacefarer Nosecone[/h3]
			A slightly larger variant of the Spacefarer Nosecone that features a larger interior.
		[*][h3]Extended Spacefarer Module[/h3]
			A larger variant of the Spacefarer Module that features a larger interior and some fancy windows.
		[*][h3]Stargazer Nosecone[/h3]
			This Habitat module functions as a nosecone while featuring a transparent interior roof. Great for looking at the stars or a nice sunbathing during the flight.
		[/list]
	[*][h2]Nosecones[/h2][list]
		[*][h3]Laser Drillcone[/h3]
			This Nosecone takes in up to 6000 Radbolts, ready to mine space pois with the power of the lazor. By default it mines at half the speed of a regular drillcone (this value can be adjusted in the mod config).
		[/list]
	[*][h2]Cargo/Storage[/h2][list]
		[*][h3]Critter Containment Module[/h3]
			Allows the transport of critters without the need to store them in the spacefarer module. Base Capacity: 5 Critters (adjustable in mod settings).
		[*][h3]Radbolt Chamber Module[/h3]
			Transport Radbolts to other planetoids with this module. Has a capacity of 3000 Radbolts with a configurable output direction.
		[/list]
	[*][h2]Power[/h2][list]
		[*][h3]Coal Generator Module[/h3]
			A generator module unlocked in the early game that uses coal to produce 200W of power. 
		[*][h3]Steam Generator Module[/h3]
			A generator module unlocked in the mid game that draws steam from gas storage to produce 400W of power.
		[*][h3]Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG)[/h3]
			A generator module unlocked in the late game that draws energy from the slow decay of radioactive isotopes to produce 120W of power.
		[/list]
[/list]

[h1]New Buildings[/h1][list]
	[*][h3]Fortified Rocket Platform[/h3]
		A more expensive Rocket Platform that features immunity to comets and adjusted logic port locations for less melting automation cables.
	[*]more wip.

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
[list]
[*] The game crashes on changing one spacefarer module to another. - even to the mod will recieve blame, this is a vanilla crash issue, just don't do that -> deconstruct the module, then construct the new one after.
[*] Camera glitches out / is black inside of rocket - A camera bug derived from the main game camera, zoom in / out to fix.
[*] Starfarer landing animation is glitchy - Basegame limitations do not allow extra animation there to fix it.
[*] Game Crash on construction of an additional rocket - you used up all the grid space with 32x32 rockets, deconstruct some of those and it should work again.
[*] Cannot place something in the rocket / space blocked / invisible mining tiles - game hiccup for not removing invisible world border neutronium, reloading fixes this.

[h1]FAQ[/h1]
[h2]What does "Interior Shrinking" mean for the game?[/h2]
The Game runs on a grid of cells with a finite size. In Spaced Out, this grid is split between the asteroids, with some space remaining unused, thus staying available as "free grid space".
In the unmodded game, creating a rocket takes 32x32 tiles from that "free grid space" and makes a "mini asteroid"-Box at that location for the rocket interior.
Since the grid space is limited and each rocket takes some of that remaining space, the game has a limit of 16 to not run out of free space for rocket interiors.

my mod significantly reduces the amount of space taken for each (new) rocket interior by removing the empty space around the interior. 
That way, you can create much more rockets, since each takes way less space from the remaining free grid space. This allows to disable the "16 rockets"-Limit without leading to "missing free space"-problems.

For comparison, this is the space taken by 9 normal sized rocket interiors:

This is the space taken by 16 shrunken (medium) interiors:
