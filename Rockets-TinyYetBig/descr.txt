[h1]Rocketry Tweaks (DLC)[/h1]

This mod decreases the map space taken up by Spacefarer Modules while adding 3 new Variants.
Also it buffs the Cartographic Module and removes the Rocket Cap of 16.

[h1]Current latest Version: 1.0.0[/h1]

[hr][/hr]
[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] Interior Shrinking: Rockets no longer take up 32x32 Tiles, instead the interior size gets set dependant on the actual interior space used (this only applies to newly constructed spacefarer modules).
[*] Rocket cap of 16 gone (Possible due to the space saving from the interior shrinking).
[*] New Spacefarer Modules: [list] 
	[*]extended Solo Nosecone & extended Spacefarer, elongated variants of the vanilla modules with custom made art.
	[*]Stargazer Nosecone: A rather small, 5 wide nosecone that has a glass dome, thus providing sunlight to the interior. It also extends a protective cover at start and landing.[/list] 
[*]Cartographic Module Buff: The Cartographic Module will now instantly reveal all Space Hexes in a radius of 1 (value adjustable in mod settings).

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
[list]
[*] Camera glitches out / is black inside of rocket - A camera bug derived from the main game camera, zoom in / out to fix.
[*] Starfarer landing animation is glitchy - Basegame limitations do not allow extra animation there to fix it.
[*] Game Crash on construction of an additional rocket - you used up all the grid space with 32x32 rockets, deconstruct some of those and it should work again.
