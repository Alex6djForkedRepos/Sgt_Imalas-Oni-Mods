[h1]Introduction[/h1]
[h2]More Rockets - more fun![/h2]

This mod aims to increase rocket versatility by adding new rocket modules, rocket mechanics and in general adding to the experience of rocketry in Spaced Out.

This mod introduces various new additions and tweaks to the spaced out rocketry system.

[h1]Current latest Version: 2.3[/h1]

[hr][/hr]
[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] Interior Shrinking: Rockets no longer take up 32x32 Tiles, instead the interior size gets set dependant on the actual interior space used (disableable, a change only applies to newly constructed modules).
[*] Removal of Rocket cap of 16 (This is possible due to the space saving from the interior shrinking).
[*] Module Building Categories - no longer an endless scrolling fest (disableable) 
[*]Tweaks: [list]
	[*]Cartographic Module Buff: The Cartographic Module will now instantly reveal all Space Hexes in a radius of 1 ( adjustable in mod settings).

Cost: 1200kg of steel, 400kg of glass.
Research: Radbolt Containment
[hr][/hr]
[h3]Coal Generator Module[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/PHzV0iX.png[/img]
A generator module unlocked in the early game that uses coal to produce 200W of power. 
Only active during flight.
When used with a battery either in module form or in the interior, it will stop producing power while the battery is >95% charged.
Cost: 500kg of any raw metal
Research: Advanced Power Regulation
[hr][/hr]
[h3]Steam Generator Module[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/B3uxCNk.png[/img]
A generator module unlocked in the mid game that draws steam from gas storage to produce 400W of power.
when used with a liquid storage module present it will output the hot water to that module (IF it has water set in its filter!).
Only active during flight.
When used with a battery either in module form or in the interior, it will stop producing power while the battery is >95% charged.
Cost: 600kg of any refined metal, 100kg of plastic.
Research: Renewable Energy
[hr][/hr]
[h3]Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG)[/h3]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/eBZ3Wiy.png[/img]
A generator module unlocked in the late game that draws energy from the slow decay of radioactive isotopes to produce 120W of power.
Takes in 50kg of enriched uranium that slowly decays into depleted uranium.
Always Active.
To reset the decay state of the fuel, flush the generator fuel via button and deliver a fresh batch of 50kg of enriched uranium to it.
Cost: 400kg of steel.

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
[list]
[*] The game crashes on changing one spacefarer module to another. - even to the mod will recieve blame, this is a vanilla crash issue, just don't do that -> deconstruct the module, then construct the new one after.
[*] Camera glitches out / is black inside of rocket - A camera bug derived from the main game camera, zoom in / out to fix.
[*] Starfarer landing animation is glitchy - Basegame limitations do not allow extra animation there to fix it.
[*] Game Crash on construction of an additional rocket - you used up all the grid space with 32x32 rockets, deconstruct some of those and it should work again.
[*] Cannot place something in the rocket / space blocked / invisible mining tiles - game hiccup for not removing invisible world border neutronium, reloading fixes this.

[h1]FAQ[/h1]
[h2]What does "Interior Shrinking" mean for the game?[/h2]
The Game runs on a grid of cells with a finite size. In Spaced Out, this grid is split between the asteroids, with some space remaining unused, thus staying available as "free grid space".
In the unmodded game, creating a rocket takes 32x32 tiles from that "free grid space" and makes a "mini asteroid"-Box at that location for the rocket interior.
Since the grid space is limited and each rocket takes some of that remaining space, the game has a limit of 16 to not run out of free space for rocket interiors.

my mod significantly reduces the amount of space taken for each (new) rocket interior by removing the empty space around the interior. 
That way, you can create much more rockets, since each takes way less space from the remaining free grid space. This allows to disable the "16 rockets"-Limit without leading to "missing free space"-problems.

For comparison, this is the space taken by 9 normal sized rocket interiors:

This is the space taken by 16 shrunken (medium) interiors:
