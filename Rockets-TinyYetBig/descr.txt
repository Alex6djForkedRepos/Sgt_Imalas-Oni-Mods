[h1]Rocketry Expanded (DLC)[/h1]
[h2]More Rockets - more fun![/h2]

This mod decreases the map space taken up by Spacefarer Modules while adding 3 new Variants.
Also it buffs the Cartographic Module and removes the Rocket Cap of 16.

[h1]Current latest Version: 2.0.0[/h1]

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] Interior Shrinking: Rockets no longer take up 32x32 Tiles, instead the interior size gets set dependant on the actual interior space used (this only applies to newly constructed spacefarer modules).
[*] Rocket cap of 16 gone (This is possible due to the space saving from the interior shrinking).
[*] New Spacefarer Modules: [list] 
	[*]extended Solo Nosecone & extended Spacefarer, elongated variants of the vanilla modules with custom made art.
	[*]Stargazer Nosecone: A rather small, 5 wide nosecone that has a glass dome, thus providing sunlight to the interior. It also extends a protective cover at start and landing.[/list] 
[*]Cartographic Module Buff: The Cartographic Module will now instantly reveal all Space Hexes in a radius of 1 ( adjustable in mod settings).
[*]New Modules: [list]
	[*]Radbolt Chamber Module: Transport Radbolts to other planetoids with this module. Has a capacity of 3000 Radbolts with a configurable output direction.
	[*]Critter Containment Module: Allows the transport of critters without the need to store them in the spacefarer module. Base Capacity: 5 Critters (adjustable in mod settings).

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
[list]
[*] Camera glitches out / is black inside of rocket - A camera bug derived from the main game camera, zoom in / out to fix.
[*] Starfarer landing animation is glitchy - Basegame limitations do not allow extra animation there to fix it.
[*] Game Crash on construction of an additional rocket - you used up all the grid space with 32x32 rockets, deconstruct some of those and it should work again.

[h1]FAQ[/h1]
[h2]What does "Interior Shrinking" mean for the game?[/h2]
The Game runs on a grid of cells with a finite size. In Spaced Out, this grid is split between the asteroids, with some space remaining unused, thus staying available as "free grid space".
In the unmodded game, creating a rocket takes 32x32 tiles from that "free grid space" and makes a "mini asteroid"-Box at that location for the rocket interior.
Since the grid space is limited and each rocket takes some of that remaining space, the game has a limit of 16 to not run out of free space for rocket interiors.

my mod significantly reduces the amount of space taken for each (new) rocket interior by removing the empty space around the interior. 
That way, you can create much more rockets, since each takes way less space from the remaining free grid space. This allows to disable the "16 rockets"-Limit without leading to "missing free space"-problems.

[h2]There are base game research modules in the preview?[/h2]
From my satellite mod, these are satellite carrier modules.
