[h1]Mod Preset Manager [MPM][/h1]

A lightweight way of switching out different mod loadouts on the fly, easily accessible on the main menu.
Store different mod configs and load them later to have different configurations of mod options, changable with 3 clicks.
This mod works both independent and as a supplimentary addition to Mod Profile Manager.
