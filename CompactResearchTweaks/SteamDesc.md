[h1]Features[/h1]
[list][*] Compact research entries: research entries with more than 8 items in them will now show 7 items and a "+Number" entry. It expands the list to show all items on hovering/selecting an entry
[*] "Research Complete"-Messages now list every item unlock in a new line, this prevents the popup going offscreen due to too many entries in one line.
