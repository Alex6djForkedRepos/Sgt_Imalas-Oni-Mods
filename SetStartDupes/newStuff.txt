- New Feature: Crew Presets
- crew presets store/override the entire start screen of dupes, allowing to load the entire starting group with one preset 

- fixed additional stat boni from other mods getting ignored
- overriding a skin on a duplicant with a custom name no longer overrides the custom name with the new skins' name
- interests in all screens are now correctly named (f.e. Digger -> Digging)
- interest bonus redistribution on bonus value change is now more in line with vanilla value distribution
